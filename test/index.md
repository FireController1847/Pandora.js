### Step 1
- Create a file named "username" with no extension.
- Put your username in the file.
- That's it. Don't do anything else.
- No markdown. At all. No strings. Nothing. Just the username.

### Step 2
- Create a file named "password" with no extension.
- Put your password in the file.
- Same thing. No markdown, no strings, no quotations. It is literally just your password.
